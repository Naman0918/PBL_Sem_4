            <h2>Construction:</h2>
            <p>A Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is a three-terminal device composed of a
                semiconductor material, typically silicon, with a thin layer of insulating material (oxide) on top and a
                metal
                gate electrode on the insulating layer. The MOSFET has three regions: the source, the drain, and the
                channel.
                The channel acts as a conducting path between the source and the drain.</p>

            <h2>Types:</h2>
            <p>There are two main types of MOSFETs based on the conductivity type of the channel:</p>

            <p><strong>1. N-Channel MOSFET (NMOS):</strong> In an NMOS transistor, the channel is composed of n-type
                semiconductor material. The
                majority carriers (electrons) flow through the channel when a voltage is applied between the source and
                drain
                terminals.</p>

            <p><strong>2. P-Channel MOSFET (PMOS):</strong> In a PMOS transistor, the channel is composed of p-type
                semiconductor material. The
                majority carriers (holes) flow through the channel when a voltage is applied between the source and
                drain
                terminals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component">

            <h2>Operation:</h2>
            <p>The operation of a MOSFET involves controlling the current flow through the channel by applying a voltage
                at the
                gate terminal. The MOSFET operates in three different regions:</p>

            <p><strong>1. Cut-off Region:</strong> When the gate-to-source voltage (VGS) is below the threshold voltage
                (Vth), the MOSFET is in
                the cut-off region. In this region, the transistor is off, and the channel is depleted of charge
                carriers,
                resulting in negligible current flow between the source and drain.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Triode (Linear) Region:</strong> When VGS is above Vth, but the voltage between the drain and
                source (VDS) is low, the
                MOSFET operates in the triode region. In this region, the channel is conducting, and the current flow
                between
                the source and drain is proportional to the VGS and VDS voltages.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Saturation Region:</strong> When VGS is above Vth, and VDS is sufficiently high, the MOSFET
                enters the saturation
                region. In this region, the channel is fully open, and the current between the source and drain is
                determined by
                the device characteristics rather than the VDS voltage.</p>

            <h2>V-I Characteristics:</h2>
            <img src="../image/IV charactristics.png" alt="">
            <p>The voltage-current (V-I) characteristics of a MOSFET show how the drain current (ID) varies with the
                drain-to-source voltage (VDS) for different gate-to-source voltages (VGS). The V-I characteristics
                typically
                consist of three regions:</p>
            <p>1. Cut-off Region: The MOSFET is off, and there is negligible drain current regardless of the VDS.</p>
            <p>2. Triode (Linear) Region: The drain current increases linearly with VDS until it reaches a maximum
                value. The
                device operates as a voltage-controlled resistor in this region.</p>
            <p> 3. Saturation Region: The drain current remains relatively constant, independent of VDS. The MOSFET
                operates as
                a voltage-controlled current source, and its output is not affected by VDS variations.

            <h2> MOSFET as Switch:</h2>
            <p>A MOSFET can be used as a switch by operating it in either the cut-off or saturation region. When the
                MOSFET is
                fully off (cut-off region), it blocks the current flow between the source and drain. When the MOSFET is
                fully on
                (saturation region), it allows a significant current to flow through the channel. By controlling the
                gate
                voltage, the MOSFET can be switched between these two states, making it an efficient switch for various
                electronic applications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component">
            <h2> MOSFET as Amplifier:</h2>
            <p>A MOSFET can also be used as an amplifier, particularly in the saturation region. By applying an input
                voltage
                signal to the gate terminal, the MOSFET amplifies the signal at the output. The input signal causes
                variations
