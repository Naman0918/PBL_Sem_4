            <h2>Operation Amplifier</h2>
            <p>An operational amplifier (op-amp) is a versatile electronic component that is widely used in various
                applications, such as amplification, filtering, and signal conditioning. It is a high-gain,
                direct-coupled
                amplifier with differential inputs and a single-ended output. Here is a breakdown of its block diagram
                and some
                common configurations.</p>

            <h2>Block Diagram:</h2>

            <br>
            <p>An op-amp typically consists of the following key blocks:</p>

            <p><strong>Differential Amplifier:</strong> This block takes in the voltage difference between the two input
                terminals (inverting
                and non-inverting) and amplifies it.</p>

            <p><strong>Voltage Amplifier:</strong> The amplified voltage from the differential amplifier is further
                amplified by a high-gain
                voltage amplifier stage.</p>

            <p><strong>Output Stage: </strong>This block provides a buffered output voltage that is capable of driving
                external loads.</p>

            <p><strong>Power Supplies:</strong> Op-amps require power supplies to operate. The positive and negative
                supply voltages provide the
                necessary biasing and operating voltage levels for the internal circuitry.</p>

            <h2>Ideal Operational Amplifier:</h2>
            <p>
                The ideal op-amp is a theoretical model that assumes certain characteristics to simplify circuit analysis. The
        ideal op-amp possesses the following ideal properties:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Infinite Open-Loop Gain (A):</strong> The voltage gain of the op-amp is assumed to be infinite, meaning it can amplify
        the input signal with perfect accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong> Infinite Input Impedance:</strong> The input impedance of an ideal op-amp is considered to be infinite, ensuring that no
        current flows into the input terminals.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Zero Output Impedance:</strong> The output impedance of an ideal op-amp is considered to be zero, meaning it can drive
        any load without affecting its output voltage.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Infinite Bandwidth:</strong> The ideal op-amp has an infinite bandwidth, allowing it to amplify signals of any frequency
        without distortion.
            </p>

            <h2>Inverting Amplifier:</h2>
            <p>The inverting amplifier is a commonly used configuration of an op-amp. It produces an output that is the
                inverted and amplified version of the input voltage applied to the inverting terminal. The non-inverting
                terminal is typically connected to a reference voltage (e.g., ground). The gain of the inverting
                amplifier is
                determined by the ratio of the input and feedback resistors.</p>

        <div class="component">

            <h2>Non-Inverting Amplifier:</h2>
            <p>
                The non-inverting amplifier is another popular configuration. In this setup, the input signal is applied
                to the
                non-inverting terminal, while the inverting terminal is connected to the output via a feedback resistor.
                The
                output voltage is in phase with the input voltage, and the gain is determined by the ratio of the
                feedback and
                input resistors.

        <div class="component">
            <p>Both the inverting and non-inverting amplifiers utilize negative feedback, which improves stability,
                linearity,
                and reduces distortion in the amplifier circuit.</p>
