            <h2>Zener Diode Circuit Diagram</h2>
            <p>
                The circuit diagram of the Zener diode is shown in the figure below. The Zener diode is employed in
                reverse biasing. The reverse biasing means the n-type material of the diode is connected to the positive
                terminal of the supply and the P-type material is connected to the negative terminal of the supply. The
                depletion region of the diode is very thin because it is made of the heavily doped semiconductor
                material.

            <h2>Working of Zener Diode</h2>
            <p>
                The Zener diode is made up of heavily doped semiconductor material. The heavily doped means the
                high-level impurities is added to the material for making it more conductive. The depletion region of
                the Zener diode is very thin because of the impurities. The heavily doping material increases the
                intensity of the electric field across the depletion region of the Zener diode even for the small
                reverse voltage.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="component">

            <p>When no biasing is applied across the Zener diode, the electrons remains in the valence band of the
                p-type material and no current flow through the diode. The band in which the valence electrons
                (outermost orbit electron) place is known as the valence band electron. The electrons of the valence
                band easily move from one band to another when the external energy is applied across it.</p>


            <p>When the reverse bias applies across the diode and the supply voltage is equal to the Zener voltage then
                it starts conducting in the reverse bias direction. The Zener voltage is the voltage at which the
                depletion region completely vanish.</p>



            <p>The reverse bias applies across the diode increases the intensity of electric field across the depletion
                region. Thus, it allows the electrons to move from the valence band of P-type material to the conduction
                band of N-type material. This transferring of valence band electrons to the conduction band reduces the
                barrier between the p and n-type material. When the depletion region become completely vanish the diode
                starts conducting in the reverse biased.</p>

            <h2>Characteristic of Zener Diode</h2>
            <p>
                The VI characteristic graph of the Zener diode is shown in the figure below. This curve shows that the
                Zener diode, when connected in forwarding bias, behaves like an ordinary diode. But when the reverse
                voltage applies across it and the reverse voltage rises beyond the predetermined rating, the Zener
                breakdown occurs in the diode.

            <p>At Zener breakdown voltage the current starts flowing in the reverse direction. The graph of the Zener
                breakdown is not exactly vertical shown above which shows that the Zener diode has resistance. The
                voltage across the Zener is represented by the equation shown below.</p>

            <h2>Applications of Zener Diode</h2>
            <p>
                The Zener diode is mostly used in the commercial and industrial applications. The following are the main
                application of the Zener diode.
            </p>
            <p>

                As Voltage Stabilizer - The Zener diode is used for regulating the voltage. It provides the constant
                voltage from the fluctuating voltage source to the load. The Zener diode is connected in parallel across
                the load and maintain the constant voltage VZ and hence stabilises the voltage.
            </p>
            <p>

                <strong>For Meter Protection</strong> - The Zener diode is generally used in multimeters for controlling
                the movement of
                the meter against accidental overloads. It is connected in parallel with the diode. When the overload
                occurs across the diode most of the current pass through the diode. Thus, protects the meter from
                damage.
            </p>
            <p>

                <strong>For Wave Shaping</strong> - The Zener diode is used for converting the sine wave into the square
                wave.This can be
                done by placing the two Zener Diodes in series with the resistance. The diode is connected back to back
                and in the opposite direction.

            <h2><strong>Light Emitting Diode</strong></h2>
            <p>
                The lighting emitting diode is a p-n junction diode. It is a specially doped diode and made up of a
                special
                type of semiconductors. When the light emits in the forward biased, then it is called a light-emitting
                diode.

                The LED symbol is similar to a diode symbol except for two small arrows that specify the emission of
                light,
                thus it is called LED (light-emitting diode). The LED includes two terminals namely anode (+) and the
                cathode (-). The LED symbol is shown below.

            <h2>Construction of LED</h2>
            <img src="../image/ledconstruction.png" alt="">
            <p>The construction of LED is very simple because it is designed through the deposition of three
                semiconductor
                material layers over a substrate. These three layers are arranged one by one where the top region is a
                P-type region, the middle region is active and finally, the bottom region is N-type. The three regions
                of
                semiconductor material can be observed in the construction. In the construction, the P-type region
                includes
                the holes; the N-type region includes elections whereas the active region includes both holes and
                electrons.</p>
            <p>When the voltage is not applied to the LED, then there is no flow of electrons and holes so they are
                stable.
                Once the voltage is applied then the LED will forward biased, so the electrons in the N-region and holes
                from P-region will move to the active region. This region is also known as the depletion region. Because
                the
                charge carriers like holes include a positive charge whereas electrons have a negative charge so the
                light
                can be generated through the recombination of polarity charges.</p>

            <h2>How does the Light Emitting Diode Work?</h2>
            <p>The light-emitting diode simply, we know as a diode. When the diode is forward biased, then the electrons
                &
                holes are moving fast across the junction and they are combined constantly, removing one another out.
                Soon
                after the electrons are moving from the n-type to the p-type silicon, it combines with the holes, then
                it
                disappears. Hence it makes the complete atom & more stable and it gives the little burst of energy in
                the
                form of a tiny packet or photon of light.</p>

            <p>From the above diagram, we can observe that the N-type silicon is in red color including the electrons
                which
                are indicated by the black circles.
                The P-type silicon is in the blue color and it contains holes, they are indicated by the white circles.
                The power supply across the p-n junction makes the diode forward biased and pushing the electrons from
                n-type to p-type. Pushing the holes in the opposite direction.
                Electron and holes at the junction are combined.
                The photons are given off as the electrons and holes are recombined.</p>

            <h2>Photo Diode</h2>
            <p>
                A photodiode is a PN-junction diode that consumes light energy to produce an electric current. They are
                also called a photo-detector, a light detector, and a photo-sensor. Photodiodes are designed to work in
                reverse bias condition. Typical photodiode materials are Silicon, Germanium and Indium gallium arsenide.

            <h2>Working Of Photodiode</h2>

            <p>The working principle of a photodiode is, when a photon of ample energy strikes the diode, it makes a
                couple of an electron-hole. This mechanism is also called the inner photoelectric effect. If the
                absorption arises in the depletion region junction, then the carriers are removed from the junction by
                the inbuilt electric field of the depletion region.</p>
            <img src="../image/Photodiode_working.gif" alt="" width="30%">
            <p>Therefore, holes in the region move toward the anode, and electrons move toward the cathode, and a
                photocurrent will be generated. The entire current through the diode is the sum of the absence of light
                and the photocurrent. So the absent current must be reduced to maximize the sensitivity of the device.
