            <h2>Construction of Diode</h2>
            <p>
                There are two types of semiconductor material; Intrinsic and Extrinsic semiconductor. An intrinsic
                semiconductor is a pure semiconductor in which hole and electrons are available in equal numbers at room
                temperature. In an extrinsic semiconductor, impurities are added to increase the number of holes or the
                number of electrons. These impurities are tri-valent (boron, indium, aluminum) or pentavalent
                (phosphorous, Arsenic, Antimony).
            </p>
            <p>
                A semiconductor diode has two layers. One layer is made of a P-type semiconductor layer and the second
                layer is made of an N-type semiconductor layer.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we add trivalent impurities in silicon or germanium, a greater number of holes are present and it is
                a positive charge. Hence, this layer is known as the P-type layer.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we add pentavalent impurities in silicon or germanium, a greater number of electrons are present and
                it is a negative change. Hence, this layer is known as the N-type layer.

            </p>
            <p>
                The diode is formed by joining both N-type and P-type semiconductors together. This device is a
                combination of P-type and N-type semiconductor material hence it is also known as PN Junction Diode.

                A junction is formed between the P-type and N-type layers. This junction is known as PN junction.
            </p>
            <p>
                A diode has two terminals; one terminal is taken from the P-type layer and it is known as Anode. The
                second terminal is taken from the N-type material and it is known as Cathode.
            </p>
            <p>The below figure shows the basic construction of the diode.</p>

            <h2>Working Of Diode</h2>
            <p>
                In the N-type region, electrons are the majority charge carriers and holes are minority charge carriers.
                In the P-type region, the holes are majority charge carrier and the electrons are negative charge
                carriers. Because of the concentration difference, majority charge carriers diffuse and recombine with
                the opposite charge. It makes a positive or negative ion. These ions are collected at the junction. And
                this region is known as the depletion region.

            </p>
            <p>
                When anode terminal of diode is connected with a negative terminal and cathode is connected with the
                positive terminal of a battery, the diode is said to be connected in reverse bias.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, when anode terminal is connected with a positive terminal and cathode is connected with the
                negative terminal of the battery, the diode is said to be connected in forward bias.
            </p>

            <h2>Operation of Diode in Reverse Bias Condition</h2>

            <p>
                The diode is connected in reverse bias. In this condition, free electrons diffusing into the P-type
                regions and recombine with holes. It will create negative ions. Similarly, holes diffuse into the N-type
                region and recombine with electrons. It will create positive ions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The connection diagram is as shown in the below figure.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>
                When such voltage is applied to the circuit, immobile ions create a depletion region as shown in the
                above figure. The width of the depletion region is large. Hence, no more hole or electron crosses the
                junction.
            </p>
            <p>
                It cannot create a flow of electrons or holes even if it is supplied at rated voltage. Hence, it is not
                possible to flow the current through the diode and it behaves as an open switch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here a very small amount of current will flow through the circuit. This current is known as reverse
                saturation current or reverses leakage current. This current flow due to the minority charge carriers.
                This current is not high enough to conduct the diode.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we increase the voltage up to reverse breakover voltage, the minority charge carriers get high
                kinetic energy and collide with atoms. In this condition, the number of covalent bonds broken and a huge
                number of electrons-holes pair generates a huge amount of flow of current.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to this high amount of current, a diode may get damaged. Hence, in general condition, the diode is
                not connected in reverse bias.
            </p>

            <h2>Operation of Diode in Forward Bias Condition</h2>

            <p> When the anode is connected with the positive terminal of the battery and cathode is connected with a
                negative terminal of the battery, the anode is positive with respect to the cathode. And the diode is
                said to be connected in forward bias.
            </p>
            <p> Now, we gradually increase the supply voltage. If we increase a small voltage, the majority charge
                carrier does not get sufficient energy to cross the depletion region.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the forward bias conditions, the width of the depletion region is very small. If we increase the
                voltage more than forward breakover voltage, the majority charge carrier gets enough energy to cross the
                depletion region.
            </p>
            <p>
                For silicon forward breakover voltage is 0.7V and for germanium forward breakover voltage is 0.3V.
            </p>
            <p>
                When supply voltage increases more than this voltage, the majority charge carriers flowing through the
                circuit and it made the diode conducting.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this mode of operation, a very small amount of drop occurs. This drop is known as an on-state voltage
                drop.
