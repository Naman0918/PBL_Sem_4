        <h2>Semiconductors</h2>
        <p>Semiconductors are defined as substances whose conductivity lies between that of an insulator
            and a conductor. Depending on whether a semiconductor is doped with impurities or not, they are
            classified into the following two types.
            <ul>
                <li>Intrinsic Semiconductors</li>
                <li>Extrinsic semiconductors</li>
            </ul>
                
            Furthermore, depending on the number of valence electrons present in the doped impurity atom,
            extrinsic semiconductors are further subdivided into the following two categories -
            <ul>
                <li>N-Type Semiconductors</li>
                <li>P-Type Semiconductors</li>
            </ul>
            In this article, we will focus on the important differences between the two types of extrinsic
            semiconductors namely : n-type and p-type semiconductors.

        <h2>What is an N-Type Semiconductor?</h2>
        <p>
            N-Type Semiconductors : are a category of extrinsic semiconductor materials in which a natural
            form of intrinsic semiconductor such as Silicon, with 4 valence electrons, is doped with pentavalent
            elements such as Arsenic (As), Bismuth (Bi), etc., having five valence electrons.
            The four valence electrons of tetravalent Silicon form a strong covalent bond with that of the four
            out of the five valence electrons of the pentavalent atom impurity, resulting in the release of one
            free electron by each impurity atom that is doped with the pure intrinsic semiconductor. These free
            electrons result in the semiconductor being rich in negatively charged freely moving electrons,
            responsible for the increased conductivity of the semiconductor material.
            Furthermore, an increase in the temperatures would result in an increase in the conductivity of the
            n-type semiconductor material. Due to the ability of the pentavalent impurity atoms to generate or
            donate free electrons, n-type semiconductors are also referred to as ‘donor impurity atoms.
        </p>

    <div class="component">
        <h2>What is a P-Type Semiconductor?</h2>
        <p>
            P-type semiconductors are also a type of extrinsic semiconductor material in which a pure natural
            form of intrinsic semiconductors such as Germanium or silicon (having 4 valence electrons) is
            mixed with trivalent elements such as Aluminium (Al) having three valence electrons.
            The four valence electrons of tetravalent Germanium form a strong covalent bond with that of three
            out of the three valence electrons of Aluminium, resulting in the release formation of a hole. These
            free holes result in the semiconductor being rich in positively charged freely moving holes, which
            are responsible for the increased conductivity of the semiconductor material.
            Furthermore, an increase in the temperatures would result in an increase in the conductivity of the
            p-type semiconductor material. Due to the ability of the pentavalent impurity atoms to generate or
            donate free electrons, n-type semiconductors are also referred to as ‘acceptor impurity atoms’.

            Current in semiconductors(Diffusion and Drift current):
        </h2>
        <p>
            <h2>What is a Drift Current?</h2>
            Drift current can be defined as the charge carrier’s moves in a semiconductor because of the electric 
            field. There are two kinds of charge carriers in a semiconductor like holes and electrons. Once the 
            voltage is applied to a semiconductor, then electrons move toward the +Ve terminal of a battery 
            whereas the holes travel toward the –Ve terminal of a battery.
            Here, holes are positively charged carriers whereas the electrons are negatively charged carriers. Therefore, 
            the electrons attract by the +Ve terminal of a battery whereas the holes attract by the -Ve terminal of a 
            battery

        <h2>What is Diffusion Current?</h2>
        <P>
            The diffusion current can be defined as the flow of charge carriers within a semiconductor travels 
            from a higher concentration region to a lower concentration region. A higher concentration region is 
            nothing but where the number of electrons present in the semiconductor. Similarly, a lower 
            concentration region is where the less number of electrons present in the semiconductor. The
            process of diffusion mainly occurs when a semiconductor is doped non-uniformly.
            In an N-type semiconductor, when it is doped non-uniformly then a higher concentration region can 
            be formed at the left side whereas the lower concentration region can be formed at the right side. 
            The electrons in the higher concentration region are more in the semiconductor so they will 
            experience a repulsive force from each other.
