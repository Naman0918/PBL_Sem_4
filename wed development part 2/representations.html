    <h1>Graph and its representations</h1>
    <h2>Representations</h2>
    <p>The following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adjacency Matrix</li>
        <li>Adjacency List</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are other representations also like, Incidence Matrix and Incidence List. The choice of graph representation is situation-specific. It totally depends on the type of operations to be performed and the ease of use.</p>
    <h2>Adjacency List:</h2>
       <p> An adjacency list is a simple way to represent a graph as a list of vertices, where each vertex has a list of its adjacent vertices. Here's an example of an adjacency list for an undirected graph with 4 vertices:
        makefile</p>
       <p> Copy code<br>
        0: 1 3<br>
        1: 0 2<br>
        2: 1 3<br>
        3: 0 2<br>
        In this example, vertex 0 is adjacent to vertices 1 and 3, vertex 1 is adjacent to vertices 0 and 2, and so on.
        </p>

        <h2>Adjacency Matrix:</h2>
        <p>Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph. Let the 2D array be adj[][], a slot adj[i][j] = 1 indicates that there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j. The adjacency matrix for an undirected graph is always symmetric.</p>
        <p>Adjacency Matrix is also used to represent weighted graphs. If adj[i][j] = w, then there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j with weight w. </p>
