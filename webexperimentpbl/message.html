    <b><h2 class="objects_classes2"></h2></b>
    <p class="objects_classes30">In object-oriented programming (OOP), message passing refers to the process of communicating between objects by invoking methods on them. It allows objects to interact with each other, exchange information, and trigger actions. </p>
    <p class="objects_classes30">In Java, message passing is typically accomplished through method calls. When an object sends a message to another object, it invokes a method on the receiving object, passing any necessary parameters. The receiving object then executes the method and performs the requested operation.</p>

                <p class="objects_classes1">1.Message Passing in terms of computers is communication between processes. It is a form of communication used in object-oriented programming as well as parallel programming. Message passing in Java is like sending an object i.e. message from one thread to another thread</p>
                <p class="objects_classes1">2.It is used when threads do not have shared memory and are unable to share monitors or semaphores or any other shared variables to communicate.</p>
                
                <p class="objects_classes1">3. Suppose we consider an example of producer and consumer, likewise what producer will produce, the consumer will be able to consume that only. We mostly use Queue to implement communication between threads.</p>

    <h3 class="encap_example" >EXPLAINATION:</h3>
    <p class="objects_classes1">In the above example, the Car class defines three methods: start(), accelerate(), and stop(). </p>
        <p class="objects_classes1">The main method in the Main class creates a Car object named car. Through message passing, the start(), accelerate(), and stop() methods are invoked on the car object, causing it to perform the corresponding actions.</p>
        <p class="objects_classes1">Message passing allows objects to collaborate and perform complex operations by delegating tasks to other objects. It enables modular and loosely coupled designs, as objects can interact with each other without needing to know the internal details of how the other objects work.</p>
        <p class="objects_classes1"> It is important to note that in Java, message passing is primarily achieved through method calls, and objects communicate by invoking methods on each other.</p>
