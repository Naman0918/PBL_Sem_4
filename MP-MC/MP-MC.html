            <h2>Microprocessor:</h2>
            <p>A microprocessor is a central processing unit (CPU) that is designed to execute instructions and perform
                arithmetic and logical operations. It is the heart of a computer system and is responsible for
                processing
                data and controlling the overall operation of the system.</p>

               <p> Here are some key characteristics of
                microprocessors:</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>CPU Focus:</strong> A microprocessor primarily focuses on processing data and executing
                instructions. It is typically
                used in systems where the main tasks involve data processing and control, such as personal computers,
                servers, and high-level computing devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>External Components:</strong> Microprocessors usually require additional external components,
                such
                as memory chips,
                input/output (I/O) devices, and support chips, to form a complete functional system. These external
                components need to be interfaced with the microprocessor for memory storage, data input/output, and
                other
                peripheral functionalities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Microprocessors offer high flexibility, as they can be programmed and
                reprogrammed to perform a
                wide range of tasks. They are designed to handle general-purpose computing and can execute a variety of
                software applications.

            <h2>Microcontroller:</h2>
            <p>A microcontroller is an integrated circuit that combines a microprocessor core with memory, input/output
            peripherals, and other features necessary for a standalone embedded system. It is designed to perform
            specific tasks and control dedicated hardware.</p>

            <br> 
            <p>Here are some key characteristics of microcontrollers:</p>

            <p><strong>Integrated System:</strong> Microcontrollers are self-contained systems that include a microprocessor core, memory
            (both program and data memory), input/output ports, timers/counters, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs),
            and other peripherals on a single chip. These integrated components make microcontrollers suitable for
            low-power and cost-effective applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Task-Specific:</strong> Microcontrollers are designed for specific tasks or applications, such as controlling
            appliances, automotive systems, industrial automation, consumer electronics, and small-scale embedded
            systems. They are optimized to efficiently handle real-time tasks and interact with the physical world.</p>

            <p><strong>Limited External Components:</strong> Microcontrollers require fewer external components compared to microprocessors,
            as most essential peripherals are already integrated into the chip. Typically, additional components like
            sensors, actuators, and display units are connected directly to the microcontroller's pins.</p>

            <p><strong>Firmware-Based:</strong> Microcontrollers are typically programmed using firmware, which is stored in the
            microcontroller's program memory. The firmware defines the behavior and functionality of the microcontroller
            in the embedded system.</p>
