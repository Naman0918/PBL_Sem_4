        <h2>What is an Electronic Component?</h2>
        <p> Electronic component is a basic fundamental building block of any electronic system 
            precisely used to affect electrons and their associated fields
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "component">
            <p>
                Depending upon the power delivering or absorbing ability, the electronic components can be classified 
                in following two types âˆ’
                <ul>
                    <li>Active Components</li>
                    <li>Passive Components</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The most significant difference between active components and passive components is that an active 
                component can supply power to an electric circuit, whereas a passive component cannot deliver 
                power, it can only absorb the power in the circuit.

            <h2>What is an Active Component?</h2>
            <p> An electric circuit element which can supply electric power to the circuit or power gain in the circuit, 
                is known as an active element or active component.
                Some common examples of active circuit elements are energy sources (voltage sources or current 
                sources), generators or alternators, semiconductor devices such as transistors, photodiodes, etc.
                The active elements are the circuit component which are entirely responsible for the flow of electric 
                current in the circuit.

            <h2>What is a Passive Component?</h2>
                <p>The circuit element which can only absorb electrical energy and dissipates it in the form of heat or 
                    stores in either magnetic field or electric field is known as passive circuit component or simply 
                    passive component.
                    Therefore, a passive component cannot provide electric power or power amplification in an electric 
                    circuit. Some common examples of passive circuit components are resistor, inductor, capacitor and 
                    transformer, etc
